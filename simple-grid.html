          I would love to visit Palermo, Italy because i am obssessed with
          pasta! I would love to visit this city because of the their rich
          culture, architechture and mainly the traditional cuisines.The place
          is very affordable as it is a University area, the best experience at
          a cheaper price. IT is very safe and "walk" friendly.
