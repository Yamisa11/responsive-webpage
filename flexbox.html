        <p>I would love to visit Palermo, Italy because i am obssessed with pasta! I would love to visit this city because of the their rich culture, architechture and mainly the traditional cuisines. The place is very affordable as it is a University area, the best experience at a cheaper price. IT is very safe and "walk" friendly. </p>
